[Godron "The1" Freeman](https://github.com/The1Freeman), the man behind [Winamp 2000 SP4](https://github.com/The1Freeman/Winamp2000SP4) for giving me a huge head start with development, and implementing many more cool features, like a WMP style visualizer.

### TODO:

I might consider making alternative themes in the future:
- Royale theme
- Royale Noir theme
- Embedded theme
- Zune theme
- Whistler theme
