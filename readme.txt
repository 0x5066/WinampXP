WinampXP v1.2
Accurate Windows XP styled skin based on Winamp Classic Modern

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION:

To install, simply extract the folders to your Winamp skin directory.
Olive Green, Silver and Zune themes share code from the base WinampXP skin, so they
won't work on their own.
