WinampXP v1.1.2
A Winamp modern skin based on the looks of Windows XP that aims for accuracy.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION:

To install, simply extract the folders to your Winamp skin directory.
Olive Green, Silver and Zune themes share code from the base WinampXP skin, so they
won't work on their own.

Special thanks:

Victhor, the original creator of Winamp Classic Modern, which is the foundation
for this project.

Godron "The1" Freeman, the man behind Winamp 2000 SP4 for giving me a huge head
start with development, and implementing many more cool features, like a
WMP style visualizer.

Teil, for making the Zune theme a reality.

Version 1.1.1 contains multiple bug fixes from the previous release.
Version 1.1.2 includes a new "Zune" theme by Teil.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KNOWN BUGS:
- Visualizer might appear broken on some WACUP betas, this can be fixed by changing
  vis style.
